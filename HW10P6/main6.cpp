Description: This program was written to solve the Bronson Exercises 13.2 (P. 738) Exercise 5. This code requires a single structure data type. This structure must interactively accept the chart's data in an array of 5 structures. After data entry, the program needs to create a report listing each of the car's numbers and its MPG. The fleet average MPG should also be calculated at the end.
